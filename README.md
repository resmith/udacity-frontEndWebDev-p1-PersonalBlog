## Notes

- To auto-refresh the page every 3 seconds during development, uncomment the following in index.html

```
   <meta http-equiv="refresh" content="3" />
```

- Used <link > for importing stylesheets instead of @import based on StackOverflow recommendation
  [Link vs import](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10036977/best-way-to-include-css-why-use-import)
